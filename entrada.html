            <p>Ohh yea, you gotta get schwifty. Yeah, those two were fucking. I'm sorry, Morty. It's a bummer. In reality you're as dumb as they come. Allahu blehhhh Akbar!</p>

            <p>If you're talking to a cat, it's an abnormal event, unrelated to me. Like when you went to Pluto or fucked my daughter. What, I'm gonna touch it, and you're gonna tell me it's an alien dick or something? Meeseeks were not born into this world fumbling for meaning, Jerry! Rubber baby buggy bumpers!</p>
            
            <p>Dont look at me! That guy over there roped me into this. That, out there. That's my grave. On one of our adventures Rick and I basically destroyed the whole world. So we bailed on that reality and we came to this one. Because in this one the world wasn't destroyed. And in this one, we were dead. So we came here a-a-and we buried ourselves and we took their place. And every morning, Summer, I eat breakfast 2 Ooohhh can do. You know who's into dragons, Morty? Nerds who refuse to admit they're Christian.</p>
            
            <p>Hmmm, human music. Where do you want to die? Do you know how many characters there are in the Simpsons Morty? There's like a-a billion characters, M-Morty. There was an episode where Former President BUSH was their neighbor! He's not a hot girl. He can't just bail on his life and set up shop in someone else's.</p>
            
            <p>Slow down! Oh, wow. That's an intense line of questioning, Snuffles Countries known for their sexually aggressive men. Hello Jerry, come to rub my face in urine again?</p>
            
            <p>You don't get to tell me what to look at. I've seen your Pornhub account. Also, who makes a Pornhub account? Oh I say good sir, oh harumph, ohh a bope-a-dope-o-bobo. Ooohhh can do. 25 shmeckles? I-I-I-I don't even know what that- what is that? Is that a lot?</p>
            
            <p>Right, Crocubot. So, you're half cold unfeeling reptile, half also cold equally unfeeling machine? Yeah, sure, I mean, if you spend all day shuffling words around, you can make anything sound bad. We will return… possibly in different clothing. Oh, yeah! We're like Luke and Leia! ...Uh, except no kissing part. What's another famous brother–sister team?</p>
            
            <p>Sorry I didn't listen to you and tried to kill the whole world and stuff. Guess I gotta learn how to live in the moment a little more. You’re like Hitler, but even Hitler cared about Germany or something. I'll tell you how I feel about school, Jerry. It's a waste of time. Bunch of people runnin' around bumpin' into each other, got a guy up front says, '2 + 2,' and the people in the back say, '4.' Then the bell rings and they give you a carton of milk and a piece of paper that says you can go take a dump or somethin'. I mean, it's not a place for smart people, Jerry. I know that's not a popular opinion, but that's my two cents on the issue. This is Principal Vagina. No relation.</p>
            
            <p>What are you looking at, mother fucker! Then let me GET to know you! If you're talking to a cat, it's an abnormal event, unrelated to me. Like when you went to Pluto or fucked my daughter. Morty, can you get to the left nipple?</p>
            
            <p>Looks like some sort of legally safe knockoff of an '80s horror character with miniature swords for fingers instead of knives! Not so fast Morty. You heard your mom. We've got adventures to go on, Morty. Just you and me. And sometimes your sister, and sometimes your mom, but never your dad. You wanna know why, Morty? Because he crossed me. What about the reality where Hitler cured cancer, Morty? The answer is: Don't think about it. I am not putting my father in a home! He just came back into my life, and you want to, grab him and, stuff him under a mattress like last month's Victoria's Secret?!</p>
